<p>It's quiet in the house. A noise that any veteran parent is terrified of. Nehemiah is nowhere to be seen. "Nehemiah?", calls out his dad. No response. Panic and worry ensues. As dad walks down the hall towards the stairs, he hears an unusual noise come from the bathroom. Quickly, dad goes to investigate. He walks in to find Nehemiah furiously stabbing at the toilet with a toilet brush and a look of desperation on his face. He has curiously emptied the toilet roll into the toilet bowl. Flushing the disaster away is out of the question. Dad must quickly step out of view so the cheeky toddler doesn't catch his father laughing at his misdoing. "I fix it dad!", he frantically calls out while trying his hardest to fix it any way he knows how to.</p>
