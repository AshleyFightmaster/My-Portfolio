<p>It was the middle of the night. The house was quiet. Two small children were warmly tucked into their beds. Dad was getting everything ready for the arrival of his third child, a baby girl.  Mom was in the depths of labor. The midwife had been called and was on her way. The photographer arrived quietly and began capturing the event. Mom was focused, controlling her breathing, relaxing her body. The moment she had been preparing for had finally arrived. Labor progresses. It is becoming increasing more difficult for mom to focus and relax. Dad calls the midwife, "Are you close?". She respondes, "I'll be there soon." The baby is coming. Mom's water breaks! One final push. A baby girl is born. Her shaken father catches her. A late midwife misses the birth. A calm photographer instructs the frazzled parents in what to do next. Everyone is overcome with joy and happiness with the arrival of the baby girl.</p>
