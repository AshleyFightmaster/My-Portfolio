                <p>My three children, Beth-Renee, Nehemiah and Raphaella, are loudly playing and laughing in the other room. I am sitting, resting thinking about what I will cook for dinner. My husband, Keith, is on his way home from work, a short 10 minuet drive away.  A surprise awaits us this spring, a baby, our fourth. How exciting! My life is full of energy, laughter, small children and hard work. What a blessing. What a gift! </p>

                <h1>Why Do I Want to become a Web Developer?</h1>
                <p>You may be saying to yourself,"This lady is crazy! Pregnant with her fourth baby, raising three children and a homemaker, why would she even think about going to school full time for three months?" Well, I am asking myself the same question! What am I getting myself into? In this day in age, families like mine need to have two incomes in the household. It is so hard to make ends meet with just one. So I am making a small sacrifice now to learn a skill that is in high demand; but not just any skill, a skill that will allow me to work from home so that I can continue to take care of my babies and home. I am doing this for them, for my family, and I am happy to do it as well.</p>
