<p>Playing at grandma's house is always a blast. Bunkbeds, orbez, play sand, Alexa and a trampoline just to name a few things that my kids look forward to about their grandparents house. In her uncle's bedroom, Beth-Renee and her grandma were playing on the bunkbed and listening to music. Beth-Renee politly asks the household Alexa to please play the song "Baby Shark". The amount of times I have heard this song is unfathomable. Alexa responses in her monotone voice, "playing Baby Shark, by Pinkfong". In a whirlwind of excitment, Beth-Renee quickly climbs onto the bottom bunk, thanks Alexa, and quickly stands up ramming her head into the top bunk. A grandma fail if there ever was one. Grandma filmed the whole event. A polite little girl just wanted to listen to her favorite song and instead ended up in a puddle of tears on the floor. </p>
